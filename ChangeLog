	* libview/wrapLabel.cc:
	  - Set the alignment to 0.0, 0.0 by default. Otherwise, the
	    text alignment starts toward the center, but spans past the
	    right edge. We always set the alignment to 0.0, 0.0 in
	    Workstation, but most people aren't going to realize this is
	    needed.

	* libview/reparenter.cc:
	  - Cross-porting Regis's fix for the reparenter:

	    "gtk_widget_reparent() sometimes actually unrealizes the widget:
	    when the new parent is not realized, which is what happens here.

	    In other words, depending on whether the new parent is
	    realized or not, gtk_widget_reparent() can end up
	    unmapping/mapping the widget.

	    The problem was that the reparenter code was
	    setting mWasMapped too soon (i.e. before the call
	    to reparent()), and that value could be
	    subsequently modified by reparent(). This lead to
	    the code thinking mWasMapped was false where it
	    should have been true, and so the code was _not_
	    re-showing the GDK window asynchronously instead
	    of re-showing it."
