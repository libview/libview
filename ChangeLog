	  - Put a tab stop at then end of the entry, so leftmost selection and
	    righmost selection are symetrical and look good.
	  - Prevent the entry from scrolling.

	* libview/wrapLabel.cc:
	  - Fixed a bug in WrapLabel's wrapping. Under some rare cases, the
	    WrapLabel would temporarily grow very tall, causing the window it
	    is in to be resized. This bug has been seen only once, when used in
	    a vbox subclass widget that wasn't shown until later on in the
	    dialog. The problem turned out tobe that due to how we handle the
	    size requests and allocation, the wrap width would temporarily be
	    set to 0, before being reset to a sane width. We now just check if
	    the wrap width is 0 in SetWrapWidth, and ignore it. This doesn't
	    appear to break anything, and it fixes this bug.

	* libview/wrapLabel.cc:
	  - Set the alignment to 0.0, 0.0 by default. Otherwise, the
	    text alignment starts toward the center, but spans past the
	    right edge. We always set the alignment to 0.0, 0.0 in
	    Workstation, but most people aren't going to realize this is
	    needed.

Thu Sep 08 14:49:27 PDT 2005  Christian Hammond <chipx86@chipx86.com>

	* libview/reparenter.cc:
	  - Cross-porting Régis's fix for the reparenter:

	    "gtk_widget_reparent() sometimes actually unrealizes the widget:
	    when the new parent is not realized, which is what happens here.

	    In other words, depending on whether the new parent is
	    realized or not, gtk_widget_reparent() can end up
	    unmapping/mapping the widget.

	    The problem was that the reparenter code was
	    setting mWasMapped too soon (i.e. before the call
	    to reparent()), and that value could be
	    subsequently modified by reparent(). This lead to
	    the code thinking mWasMapped was false where it
	    should have been true, and so the code was _not_
	    re-showing the GDK window asynchronously instead
	    of re-showing it."
