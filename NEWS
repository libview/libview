version 0.6.3 (Sunday, December 7, 2008):
	* Update things to compile with the latest autotools.
	* Fix an autoDrawer assertion when running with modern GTK+ libraries.

version 0.6.2 (Monday, June 16, 2008):
	* Added a Close function to AutoDrawer, which closes the drawer
	  immediately regardless of the location of the mouse pointer.

version 0.6.1 (Tuesday, August 21, 2007):
	* FieldEntry should now have a proper minimum size, accounting for any
          extra spacing.
	* OvBox now destroys its child windows after unrealizing all children,
	  allowing child widgets to reparent their own windows before they're
	  clobbered.

version 0.6.0 (Monday, January 22, 2007):
	* Fix a bug in AutoDrawer which would spew warnings if menus did not
	  properly set their parent widget.
	* Fix a bug in AutoDrawer which was mucking up the result of
	  ViewAutoDrawer_SetOverlapPixels.
	* Add the capability for an AutoDrawer to be positioned at a certain
	  horizontal offset, rather than just toggled between fill and center.

version 0.5.6 (Thursday, December 15, 2005):
	* Fix a bug where instead of checking if an inputted character
	  was in a string consisting of mDelim and sTabChar, we were
	  checking if it was in a string consisting of the added ascii
	  values of the characters mDelim and sTabChar. This was preventing
	  the character "6" from being entered when using "-" as the
	  delimiter, which is how we found this.
	* Added a test case for the view::ContentBox widget.

version 0.5.5 (Thursday, November 10, 2005):
	* Fixed a bug in UIGroup where Merge wouldn't call Unmerge if the
	  group was already merged.
	* Fixed a bug where deactivating the AutoDrawer while it was moving
	  would not do the right thing.
	* Added support for keeping the AutoDrawer open while the focus is
	  inside it.
	* Added support for setting an alignment in the Header widget.
	* WrapLabel now wraps properly when being passed text in its
	  constructor.

version 0.5.4 (Thursday, October 27, 2005):
	* Added a missing public API function needed for AutoDrawer.

version 0.5.3 (Thursday, October 27, 2005):
	* Added the AutoDrawer widget that encapsulates the behaviour for the
	  most common Drawer use case of a auto-hiding menu/toolbar.
	* Added the FieldEntry widget, which subclasses Gtk::Entry and provides
	  multiple delimiter-separated fields with alignments and
	  per-field validation.
	* Added the IPEntry widget, which is a FieldEntry subclass for entering
	  IP addresses. Unlike most IP entries, this one makes a best attempt to
	  not get in the user's way.
	* Tidied up all C Objects to remove deprecated code, to
	  properly separate private and public data, and to add sanity
	  checks to public calls.

version 0.5.2 (Tuesday, September 27, 2005):
        * Fixed a bug in WrapLabel's wrapping that would sometimes cause
          the label to grow too high.
        * Renamed VisibilityBox to ContentBox.
        * Minor code cleanups.

version 0.5.1 (Tuesday, September 13, 2005):
        * Added a DeadEntry widget, which is a Gtk::Entry that appears
          greyed out when it's not editable.
        * Added an UndoableTextView widget, which is a Gtk::TextView that
          has built-in undo/redo support.
        * Added several small test programs.
        * Worked around a bug in WrapLabel where the alignment wasn't
          automatically set to 0, 0, which caused the text to start centered
          and wrap off the widget.
        * Fixed some bugs in Reparenter.

version 0.5.0:
        * Initial public release
