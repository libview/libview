version 0.5.1 (Tuesday, September 13, 2005):
        * Added a DeadEntry widget, which is a Gtk::Entry that appears
          greyed out when it's not editable.
        * Added an UndoableTextView widget, which is a Gtk::TextView that
          has built-in undo/redo support.
        * Added several small test programs.
        * Worked around a bug in WrapLabel where the alignment wasn't
          automatically set to 0, 0, which caused the text to start centered
          and wrap off the widget.
        * Fixed some bugs in Reparenter.

version 0.5.0:
        * Initial public release
